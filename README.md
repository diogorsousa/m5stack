# M5Stack Paper S3 Experiments

This repository contains my experiments with the M5Stack Paper S3 using MicroPython, primarily developed through the UIFlow2 web interface.

## Prerequisites

- M5Stack Paper S3 device
- UIFlow2 account (sign up at [UIFlow2](https://uiflow2.m5stack.com/))
- MicroPython firmware compatible with Paper S3

## Setup

1. Connect your M5Stack Paper S3 to your computer.
2. Open [UIFlow2](https://uiflow2.m5stack.com/) in your web browser.
3. Create a new project and select the Paper S3 as your device.
4. Upload the code from the samples to your device via UIFlow2.

## Samples

- **Touch Counter** (`samples/touch.py`): A simple touch-based counter application demonstrating basic input handling on the Paper S3.
- **Touch Helper** (`samples/touch_helper.py`): A reusable class for handling touch events, including area checking and touch release detection.
